<h2>RESEARCH INTEREST</h2>
<p>
	I got a Bachelor’s degree in Ecology at CN Zhejiang University, and my aim in life is to be a theoretical ecologist. I have a particular interest in why population dynamics can be so different, and how they contribute to complex patterns in nature. Under what conditions would a community become stable? To what extent can we identify the structural complexity of a large system? For example, chaotic dynamics have been found in many population time series. Why this chaos exists and what it means to us? In addition, I also work on developing and applying quantitative methods for the study of ecology and evolution. During my bachelor’s program, I developed an R package ‘KINNET’ for parentage analysis and a package ‘expmeasure’ for visualisation.

<h2>CURRENT RESEARCH</h2>

<p><b>Analysing Community Dynamics: Equilibrium, Stability and Beyond</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Objective: </b>Population and community dynamics have a pivotal role in shaping various ecological and evolutionary patterns. Topics such as equilibrium, stability, and sensitivity, which are mostly built up on theories of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are foundamental properties of a ecological community and are indispenable part of theories like niche-assembly rules. But currently few tools can  help to study ecological communities with ODE theories in a comprehensive manner. The current study seeks to present the R package 'ecode', which provides numerical solutions on equilibrium, stability, and sensitivity problems of any ecological communities.

<p><b>Terrestrial Vegetation Seasonality in Southern Hemisphere</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Objective: </b>Vegetation seasonality is fundamental to the study of ecosystem health and functions, the response of plants to climate change, and biodiveristy conservation. Unfortunately, very little is known about the vegetation seasonality in southern hemisphere due to the lack of long-term monitoring work and complicated seasonal dynamics. This review summarises quantitative methods to estimate land-surface phenology, drivers on the vegetation seasonality in southern lands, long-term monitoring work in southern hemisphere, and develops a new method to detect places with multiple seasonal cycles.

<h2>PAST PROJECTS</h2>
<p><b>Increased assignment rates of parentage assignment obtained by resampling populations</b>, 2022</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b>Parentage analysis provides indispensable information for the study of ecology and evolution. However, many parentage algorithms suffer from low assignment rates, especially when the number of molecular markers is less than adequate, or when prior knowledge about the study population is limited. The present study developed a novel pipeline, which uses resampling methods as an external extension, to achieve higher assignment rates of parentage analysis. The R script provided by this study helps CERVUS, one of the commonly used parentage software, to find more potential father–mother–offspring triads. This study highlights the importance of incorporating resampling methods into parentage algorithms. The framework of resampling methods is applicable to other parentage software to find more potential parent–offspring relationships

<p><b>KINNET: Reconstructing Pedigrees From the Bottom Up</b>, 2021–2022</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b> The determination of parentage of individuals based on genetic data, also known as parentage analysis, has becoming a cornerstone of research in molecular ecology. Unfortunately, many of the parentage software require prior information, such as sex and age information. Inference of parentage in a multi-generation population is rather complex. This project aims to design a R package called ‘KinNet’ which uses a mechanistic approach to reconstructing pedigrees from the bottom up

<p><b>Rethinking the Complexity and Uncertainty of Spatial Networks Applied to Forest Ecology</b>, 2021</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b> Characterizing tree spatial patterns and interactions are helpful to reveal underlying processes assembling forest communities. Spatial networks are powerful to integrate ecological processes at the cost of introducing uncertaines.  Validation methods are thus needed in order to assess whether network-based metrics can clearly identify different processes. we develop a framework to characterize spatial distribution of individual-level tree interactions based on network approaches.

<p><b>Effects of Island Network Structure on Plant Communities: A Case in Thousand Island Lake</b>, 2021</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b>Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects assembly of forest community is important. However, there is inconsistency with species-isolation relationship in previous studies. Limited studies have investigated the impact of topology of fragmented habitat on forest community structure. Thus, we are motivated to evaluate the relative spatial location of islands on the structure of plant community using network approaches.

		<b>Results: </b> We found that species diversity in islands located in the central of spatial network tend to be higher than that in islands at the edge of network. Additionally, stepping stones in network can reduce the dissimilarity of species composition between islands. We concluded that islands located in the central of the networks and that are highly affected by stepping stones can have great capacity of biodiversity maintenance.

<p><b>Multifunctional Bioprocesses in Sustainable Engineering</b>, 2020</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b> The cultivation and utilisation of algae-bacterial system has received much more attraction due to their vital role in mitigating greenhouse effect and generating renewable energy. However, much less is known about microalgae productivity under various environmental conditions especially for temperature and light intensity. The current study develop a algal-bacterial pond model, which incorporates temperate and light effect on population growth and metabolic rate based on mass transfer and energy transfer principles, to test if algae-bacterial pond is feasible for various environmental conditions.

<p><b>Effect of Seed Dispersal on the Spatial Patterns of <i>Ginkgo Biloba</i> in Refuge Population</b>, 2020</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b>Spatial patterns of standing trees give us information about complex interactions of ecological and evolutionary processes in the forest. Numerous studies have focused on spatial point pattern analysis (SPPA) to explore the underlying mechanisms that regulate spatial patterns, yet this method is not sufficient to infer underlying processes such as seed dispersal. The present study investigated the effects of seed dispersal on spatial patterns of ginkgo trees in one of their refugee population using a combination of spatial dataset and parentage analysis.

	<li>
		<b>Results: </b> 1. 92.63% of the seed dispersal events occurred within a distance of 2000 meters, indicating dispersal limitation; 2. Nonrandom dispersal as well as dispersal limitation play a complmentary role in regulating spatial patterns in ginkgo trees. The research article <i>Effects of seed dispersal on spatial patterns of Ginkgo biloba in refugee population</i> is not published.

<p><b>A Study on the Authenticity of Forest Vegetation in Mt. Changbaishan Nature Reserve</b>, 2019–2020</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Overview: </b> Ecosystem health contains multi-scale, multi-dimension, and dynamic properties. The concept of "authenticity" is thus proposed to provide an alternative way for aessessment of ecosystem health. However, little is known about hoe to quanntify ecosystem authenticity. In this study, we developed a method to quantify ecosystem authenticity and uses vegetation field meausrements in Changbai Mountain (China) as an example.
