description: I am a Master's Student at Oxford and My aim in life is to be a theoretical ecologist. I have a particular interest in why population dynamics can be so different, and how they contribute to complex patterns in nature. Under what conditions would a community become stable? To what extent can we identify the structural complexity of a large system? For example, chaotic dynamics have been found in many population time series. Why this chaos exists and what it means to us? In addition, I also work on developing quantitative methods for the study of ecological dynamics.
